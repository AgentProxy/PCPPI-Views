RUNNING THE WEBSITE IN LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:

This project uses the Laravel Framework and if tested or edited locally, it needs composer, php, and xampp to work:

TO RUN:
1. Download the latest version of Xampp
2. Install it (it comes with PHP already)
3. Download and Install Composer.exe for Windows (important for Laravel!)
	-Check if Composer was installed successfully by Opening a Command Prompt window and typing "composer". If it returns
	the composer commands then Composer was installed successfully
4. Open Xampp and start Apache and MySQL
5. Place all these files in a folder in htdocs located inside the xampp folder where you installed Xampp.
6. Open the folder and hold CTRL + SHIFT then Right click. Then click on "open command window here".
7. Type in "php artisan server" and it will return this "Laravel development server started: <http://127.0.0.1:8000>"
8. Open a web browser (preferably Google Chrome)
9. Type in the address bar "localhost:8000" then it will redirect to the homepage of this website.
